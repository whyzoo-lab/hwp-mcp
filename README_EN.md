Open **HWP/HWPX files anywhere**. Free, no installation required.

**HWP** is the dominant document format in South Korea — used by government agencies, schools, courts, and most organizations. Until now, there has been no viable open-source solution to read or edit these files.

rhwp changes that. Built with Rust and compiled to WebAssembly, it renders HWP documents directly in the browser with accuracy that matches (and sometimes exceeds) the proprietary viewer. The goal: break the walls of a closed format so that every person, every AI, and every platform can read and write Korean documents freely.

## Roadmap

Build the skeleton solo, grow the muscle together, complete it as a public good.

```
0.5 ──── 1.0 ──── 2.0 ──── 3.0
Foundation  Typeset   Collab    Complete
```

| Phase | Direction | Strategy |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **0.5 → 1.0** | Systematize the typesetting engine on a read/write foundation | Build core architecture solo, keep it solid |
| **1.0 → 2.0** | Open community participation on top of an AI-driven typesetting pipeline | Lower the barrier to contribution |
| **2.0 → 3.0** | Let community-built features elevate rhwp to a public asset | Reach parity with Hancom |

> The reason for completing the skeleton alone through v0.5.0 is simple — when the community arrives, the core architecture must already be solid so that direction does not drift.

## Milestones

- Canvas rendering (WASM/Web)
- HWP save path for native HWP editing and HWPX → HWP conversion
- Debug overlay (paragraph/table boundaries + indices + y-coordinates)

### Multi-Renderer Backends
- `PageRenderTree` can be lowered into a `PageLayerTree` paint IR before backend replay.
- P1 public surfaces are Rust native `DocumentCore::build_page_layer_tree(page)` and WASM `getPageLayerTree(page)`.
- Layer JSON starts at `schemaVersion: 1`, uses additive `schemaMinorVersion` / `resourceTableMinorVersion`, `unit: "px"`, and `coordinateSystem: "page-top-left-y-down"` to match the existing page render coordinates.
- Compatible schema changes should be additive; incompatible JSON shape changes require a schema version bump.
- **Legacy SVG** remains the default compatibility output.
- **Layered SVG** can be exercised with `RHWP_RENDER_PATH=layer-svg`.
- The layered SVG path is a transition adapter that expands `PageLayerTree` back into the existing SVG renderer.
- Browser/native Canvas paths render through `PageLayerTree` replay by default.
- Legacy Canvas remains available through `renderPageCanvasLegacy` / `renderPageToCanvasLegacy` for parity checks.
- P3 visual regression coverage runs `npm run e2e:render-diff:ci` in `rhwp-studio` to compare legacy Canvas and layer Canvas in Chromium; CI uploads render-diff artifacts and writes a summary.
- The default render-diff fixtures cover basic text/table output, business-document layout, and treat-as-char object placement; override with `RHWP_RENDER_DIFF_FILES`, `RHWP_RENDER_DIFF_MAX_PAGES`, or `RHWP_RENDER_DIFF_ALL=1`.
- P4 adds native-only `DocumentCore::render_page_png_native(page)` behind `--features native-skia`; it renders `PageLayerTree` to encoded PNG through `SkiaLayerRenderer`.
- P5 adds native Skia equation replay from `EquationNode.layout_box`, so equations are no longer placeholder boxes in the PNG path.
- P5 replays the existing equation layout tree directly; it does not add CanvasKit equation replay or native form replay.
- P6 adds native Skia `RawSvg` fragment rasterization through `resvg`, with external file href loading disabled.
- P21 adds report-first renderer baseline sweep artifacts and shared replay-plane helpers so SVG, Canvas2D, CanvasKit, and native Skia compare the same background/behindText/flow/inFrontText plane ordering before the sweep becomes a default CI gate.
- P22 keeps public Canvas on the existing layer path but reduces the WebCanvas layer adapter: core `PaintOp` leaves are replayed directly instead of being rebuilt as temporary `RenderNode` wrappers. Layer JSON also separates canonical `buildOptions`, `debugOptions`, and replay `outputOptions` metadata while keeping legacy `outputOptions` mirrors for compatibility.
- P23 promotes SVG-derived PDF export to native `DocumentCore` APIs for single-page, explicit page selection, and full-document export. The CLI `export-pdf` command now uses the same native API surface, and render-diff CI writes a report-only PDF visual diff by rasterizing `export-pdf` output against browser Canvas output. Direct/vector PDF replay remains a follow-up.
- P24-P27 harden strict text/glyph sidecar proof boundaries: bitmap/SVG glyph resource identity, variation/TTC/dataRef/digest proof, guarded orientation/transform authority, and font resolver/proof separation. `TextRun` remains the compatibility fallback whenever proof is incomplete.
- CI covers the native Skia path with `cargo test --features native-skia skia --lib`; the feature is not available on `wasm32` targets.
- The initial native Skia path is a PNG raster backend with core image/equation/raw-svg replay; full CanvasKit glyph replay, exact native glyph replay, real document font blob extraction, complex text shaping, advanced image parity, and native form replay stay as follow-up work.
- C ABI export is intentionally left for a later PR.
- `ResourceArena` now supports interned image, static SVG, and font blob resources for guarded replay proof; broader document extraction and full resource transport remain follow-up work.
- This phase establishes the frontend/backend boundary for later CanvasKit and fuller native Skia backends.

### Web Editor
- Text editing (insert, delete, undo/redo)
- Character/paragraph formatting dialogs
- Table creation, row/column insert/delete, cell formula
- hwpctl-compatible API layer (Hancom WebGian compatible)

### hwpctl Compatibility

## npm Packages — Use in Your Web Project

Current release: `@rhwp/core` / `@rhwp/editor` v0.7.17.

### Embed a Full Editor (3 lines)

Embed the complete HWP editor in your web page — menus, toolbars, formatting, table editing, everything included.

```bash
npm install @rhwp/editor
```

```html
<div id="editor" style="width:100%; height:100vh;"></div>
<script type="module">
  import { createEditor } from '@rhwp/editor';
  const editor = await createEditor('#editor');
</script>
```

### HWP Viewer/Parser (Direct API)

Use the WASM-based parser/renderer directly to render HWP files as SVG.

```bash
npm install @rhwp/core
```

```javascript
import init, { HwpDocument } from '@rhwp/core';

globalThis.measureTextWidth = (font, text) => {
  const ctx = document.createElement('canvas').getContext('2d');
  ctx.font = font;
  return ctx.measureText(text).width;
};

await init({ module_or_path: '/rhwp_bg.wasm' });

const resp = await fetch('document.hwp');
const doc = new HwpDocument(new Uint8Array(await resp.arrayBuffer()));
document.getElementById('viewer').innerHTML = doc.renderPageSvg(0);
```

| Package | Purpose | Install |
|---------|---------|---------|
| [@rhwp/editor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhwp/editor) | Full editor UI (iframe embed) | `npm i @rhwp/editor` |
| [@rhwp/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rhwp/core) | WASM parser/renderer (API) | `npm i @rhwp/core` |

## Quick Start (Build from Source)

New contributors: start with the [onboarding guide](mydocs/eng/manual/onboarding_guide.md). It covers project architecture, debugging tools, and the development workflow at a glance.

### Requirements
- Rust 1.93.1 (pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml`)
- Docker (for WASM build)
- Node.js 18+ (for web editor)

### Native Build

```bash
cargo build                    # Development build
cargo build --release          # Release build
cargo test                     # Run tests (1,100+ tests)
```

### WASM Build

The WASM build uses Docker to guarantee an identical `wasm-pack` + Rust toolchain environment across every platform.

```bash
cp .env.docker.example .env.docker   # First time: copy env template
docker compose --env-file .env.docker run --rm wasm
```

Build output goes to `pkg/`.

### Web Editor

```bash
cd rhwp-studio
npm install
npx vite --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7700
```

Open `http://localhost:7700` in your browser.

## CLI Usage

### SVG Export

```bash
rhwp export-svg sample.hwp                         # Export to output/
rhwp export-svg sample.hwp -o my_dir/              # Export to custom directory
rhwp export-svg sample.hwp -p 0                    # Export specific page (0-indexed)
rhwp export-svg sample.hwp --debug-overlay         # Debug overlay (paragraph/table boundaries)
```

### Document Inspection

```bash
rhwp dump sample.hwp                  # Full IR dump
rhwp dump sample.hwp -s 2 -p 45      # Section 2, paragraph 45 only
rhwp dump-pages sample.hwp -p 15     # Page 16 layout items
rhwp info sample.hwp                  # File info (size, version, sections, fonts)
```

### Debugging Workflow

1. `export-svg --debug-overlay` → Identify paragraphs/tables by `s{section}:pi={index} y={coord}`
2. `dump-pages -p N` → Check paragraph layout list and heights
3. `dump -s N -p M` → Inspect ParaShape, LINE_SEG, table properties

No code modification needed for the entire debugging process.

## Built with AI Pair Programming

> **This is not vibe coding.** There is no "just accept what AI gives you." Every plan is reviewed. Every output is verified. Every decision has a human behind it.

Vibe coding — hitting accept without reading, letting AI make architectural decisions, shipping code you don't understand — is a trap. It produces code that *looks* right but breaks in ways you can't diagnose, because you never understood it in the first place.

This project takes the opposite approach. A human **task director** maintains full ownership of direction, quality, and architectural decisions, while AI handles implementation at a speed and scale that would be impossible alone. The key difference: **the human never stops thinking.**

### Vibe Coding vs. Directed AI Development

| | Vibe Coding | This Project |
|--|-------------|-------------|
| **Human role** | Accept AI output | Direct, review, decide |
| **Planning** | None — "just build it" | Written plan → approval → execution |
| **Quality gate** | Hope it works | 1,100+ tests + Clippy + CI + code review |
| **Debugging** | Ask AI to fix AI's bugs | Human diagnoses, AI implements fix |
| **Architecture** | Emergent (accidental) | Deliberate (CQRS, dependency direction) |
| **Documentation** | None | 2,200+ files of process records |
| **Outcome** | Fragile, hard to maintain | Production-grade, 100K+ lines |

AI is a force multiplier, but a multiplier amplifies whatever process you already have. No process × AI = fast chaos. Good process × AI = extraordinary output.

### The Development Process

This project is developed using **[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)** (Anthropic's AI coding agent) as a pair programming partner. The entire development process is transparently documented.

```
Task Director (Human)              AI Pair Programmer (Claude Code)
─────────────────────              ────────────────────────────────
Sets direction & priorities   →    Analyzes, plans, implements
Reviews & approves plans      ←    Writes implementation plans
Provides domain feedback      →    Debugs, tests, iterates
Makes architectural decisions →    Executes with precision
Judges quality & correctness  ←    Generates code, docs, tests
```

The `mydocs/` directory (2,200+ files, English translations in `mydocs/eng/`) contains the complete development record: daily task logs, implementation plans, code review feedback, technical research documents, and debugging records.

> `mydocs/` is not documentation about the code — it is documentation about **how to build software with AI**. It is an open-source methodology.

**[Hyper-Waterfall Methodology](mydocs/eng/manual/hyper_waterfall.md)** — macro-level waterfall + micro-level agile, both made possible at once by AI.

### Git Workflow

```
local/task{N}  ──commit──commit──┐
                                  ├─→ devel merge (grouped by related tasks)
                                  ├─→ main merge + tag (release time)
```

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `main` | Release (tags: v0.5.0 etc.) |
| `devel` | Development integration |
| `local/task{N}` | GitHub Issue-numbered task branch |

### Task Management

- **GitHub Issues** auto-number tasks — no duplicates
- **GitHub Milestones** group related tasks
- Milestone notation: `M{version}` (e.g. M100=v1.0.0, M05x=v0.5.x)
- Daily tasks: `mydocs/orders/yyyymmdd.md` — referenced as `M100 #1`
- Commit messages: `Task #1: <subject>` — `closes #1` auto-closes the issue

### Task Workflow

1. `gh issue create` → register a GitHub Issue (with a milestone)
2. Create `local/task{issue-number}` branch
3. Write an implementation plan → approval → implement → test
4. Merge to `devel` → `closes #{number}`

### Debugging Protocol

1. `export-svg --debug-overlay` → Identify paragraphs/tables
2. `dump-pages -p N` → Inspect the layout item list and heights
3. `dump -s N -p M` → Inspect ParaShape, LINE_SEG details

> The documents under `mydocs/` double as educational material for AI-driven software development.

### Documentation Rules

All project documents are written in **Korean** (with English translations under `mydocs/eng/`).

```

├── plans/            # Task plans & implementation specs
│   └── archives/     # Archived completed plans
├── working/          # Step-by-step completion reports

├── tech/             # Technical documents
├── manual/           # Manuals and guides
└── troubleshootings/ # Troubleshooting records
```

| Document type | Location | Naming rule |
|---------------|----------|-------------|
| Daily task log | `orders/` | `yyyymmdd.md` — references milestone(M100) + issue(#1) |
| Task plan | `plans/` | References the issue number |

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please note the following first:

- **Target branch for PRs is `devel`**, not `main`. Although the GitHub default branch is `main`, all contributor PRs go to `devel`.
- **Check first**: Look at [open issues](https://github.com/edwardkim/rhwp/issues) and [open PRs](https://github.com/edwardkim/rhwp/pulls) to avoid duplicating in-progress work.
- **Issue close is by maintainer**: Submit only the PR for completed work. The maintainer will close the issue when the PR is merged.
- **Hancom PDFs are not authoritative ground truth**: PDF output differs across Hancom tools (Editor / Viewer / Hancom Docs), versions (2010 / 2020 / 2022), and output paths (Hancom-native / OS print). See the [Hancom PDF Environment Dependency wiki](https://github.com/edwardkim/rhwp/wiki/한컴-PDF-환경-의존성) for environment-specific comparison data and PR review guidance.

For the full contribution flow (fork → branch → commit → PR), see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
